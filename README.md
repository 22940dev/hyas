Hyas is a Hugo starter helping you build modern websites.

## Why Hyas?

Six reasons why you should use Hyas.

### Security aware

Get A+ scores on [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/hyas.netlify.app) out of the box. Easily change the default Security Headers to suit your needs.

### Fast by default

Get 100 scores on [Google Lighthouse](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=8b7aec005ae7b9e128ad5c4e2f125fea) by default. Hyas removes unused css, prefetches links, and lazy loads images.

### SEO-ready

Use sensible defaults for structured data, open graph, and Twitter cards. Or easily change the SEO settings to your liking.

### Development tools

Code with confidence. Check styles, scripts, and markdown for errors and fix automatically or manually.

### Bootstrap framework

Build robust, flexible, and intuitive websites with Bootstrap. Or use any other front-end framework if you prefer.

### Netlify-ready

Deploy to Netlify with sensible defaults. Easily use Netlify Functions, Netlify Redirects, and Netlify Headers.
